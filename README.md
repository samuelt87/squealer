Terminal-based database manager in Rust

## Aim

This project aims to create a full-featured generic database manager in
rust using the Ratatui framework.

I grew frustrated with using PGAdmin and having it crash or freeze on
me, and the simple command line psql left much to be desired. This
project should eventually allow anyone to manage any database they're
using in a powerful TUI interface.

Stretch goals are to have advanced scripting with integrated python
notebooks, csv and other ingestion (likely with DuckDB intergration),
and maybe a GUI once I find a crate I like.
